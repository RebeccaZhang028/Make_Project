EaseTrade is a completely original project for trading various items. It provides users with innovative solutions to set reasonable prices, write concise goods descriptions, and reach potential buyers within one's social range. EaseTrade can be widely applied in different communities and scenarios. They are useful for work/study relocation, house renovation, and gaining extra earning.

I programmed with GUI utilizing data scraped through the eBay API. Users could put any items and choose the condition (new, used, or whatever). The flexible drop-down menus and functional pressed-down buttons are implemented using the wx package. The system will generate the price of a list of most relevant items. Users could click the links and see the picture and information of the goods similar to what they want to sell.

The system easily calculates the price with the discount the users input. Users can put concise description and urgency level based on their needs. The system will automatically generate a complete message copied to the clipboard, ready to be posted on Facebook, implemented by the pyperclip package.

It was my first time using wx package to construct a GUI and it was challenging at first. I researched plenty of documentations online, and learned the syntax of different packages. By testing and running for several times, I was able to create various functions and features to build a user-friendly interface.

EaseTrade is the first project I established on my Github. I created a repository on Github, copied the link, and cloned it to my computer using the "git clone <repo_link>" command and change the working directory to the project folder using the cd. I then dragged my python file and two image files into this folder. I used the "git add <file_name>" command to add these files and used the "git commit -a -m '<commit_message>'" command to commit the changes. Finally, I used the "git push" command to push the changes to Github. I look forward to posting more projects and collaborating with other people.
